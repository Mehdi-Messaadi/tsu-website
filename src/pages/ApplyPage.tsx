              design team devoted to building software projects in a
              collaborative and professional environment. Our primary objective
              is to be the best space at UofC for students to find a welcoming
              community, build projects in a team setting, gain experience with
              professional tools and principles, and share their knowledge with
              others. 
              Every few semesters, our members form teams that gather together
              to brainstorm a project, and then work on that idea for anywhere
              between a single semester to over a year. During this time the
              projects evolve and shift, and our members get to experience the
              full lifecycle of bringing a complex project to life. Each team is
              lead by an experienced tech lead who provides the expertise needed
              to execute on the teamâ€™s vision. Tech Start also has mentors for
              each platform to help you learn to solve unique problems on your
              platform. We are also fortunate enough to be supported by a number
              of companies who provide us with the resources necessary to build
              our projects and run events and workshops."
